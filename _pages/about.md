I am a PhD candidate (FPI UAM2022 – Universidad Autónoma de Madrid) in the 
Department of Social Psychology and Methodology, supervised by Ricardo Olmos and
José Ángel Martínez-Huertas. My doctoral research focuses on using multilevel 
models — from both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives — to integrate 
process-outcome research in Psychology through single-case designs.

My involvement in research has included studying [myths in Psychology in Psychology students](https://peerj.com/articles/13811/#aff-1), assessing
the [quality of online psychological interventions during COVID](https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/9/1/90197/198723), and working 
on mental health epidemiology in the Edad con Salud (national) and RESPOND 
(European) projects at [CCOMS GitHub](https://github.com/CCOMS-UAM). 

At the core of my work is a strong commitment to open science. I believe that 
scientific activity depends on the context in which it unfolds, as it is a 
collective cultural practice — As a well-known Twitter user once put it, 
“La ciencia no se hace sola, hay que hacerla” — or, in English, 
“Science does not happen on its own; it must be made.” It does not emerge from 
nothing, and it must be built collectively, as it is never truly an individual endeavour.
This perspective drives my interest in research career trajectories, including 
their determinants, job insecurity, salary ranges, and the 
incentives that shape how we do scientific work. I focus on making research 
accessible and reproducible, particularly in response to the reproducibility crisis, engaging all stakeholders 
— especially those in university leadership. My contributions include, as an example,
[analyzing which are the motivations of spanish researchers to publish in open-access journals](https://redc.revistas.csic.es/index.php/redc/article/view/1555) 
and active involvement in the [Federación de Jóvenes Investigadores Precarios](https://fji.precarios.org), 
where we denounce and advocate for better conditions in research.
