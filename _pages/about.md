I am currently a PhD student/candidate ("Personal Docente e Investigador en 
Formación" - or, esentially, a research worker) at the Department of Social 
Psychology and Methodology (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid) under the supervision
of Ricardo Olmos and José Ángel Martínez-Huertas. 

I am interested in many different things and I have been lucky to explore various
academic themes. My PhD thesis focuses on how to use data analysis techniques to 
integrate process-outcome research in Psychology using multilevel models, bayesian
and frequentist approaches on single-case designs. I started researching exploring
[myths in Psychology in Psychology students](https://peerj.com/articles/13811/#aff-1)
while I was doing my Final Degree Thesis. I had my first research contract at UPF,
investigating on the [quality of online psychological interventions during COVID](https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/9/1/90197/198723). Then, I worked for almost two years on epidemiology of mental health, being part of
two research projects: "Edad con Salud" (national, Spain) and "RESPOND" (european),
which focused on the risks of general population to experiment psychological problems
and the need to identify which groups are most at risk for adverse mental health 
effects due to the covid-19 pandemic. Everything I learn about open science and
transparency was during these days, and it is registered on [CCOMS GitHUb](https://github.com/CCOMS-UAM).

I am firmly convinced that the scientific activity we carry out in our laboratories
depends on the context in which it takes place, as it is a cultural practice.
"La ciencia no se hace sola, hay que hacerla" as a famous twitter user once tweeted,
or in english "Science does not happen on its own — it must be made". Because 
it is a cultural activity; it does not emerge from nothing. And it must be made 
collectively, because it is never truly an individual endeavour. 
That is why one of my main interests (and common to all the specifics) lies 
in understanding the trajectories of people working in research — including
their determinants, job stability, salary ranges, and job insecurity — as well 
as the incentives that shape these trajectories and the very content of such paths.

In particular, I have focused on open science: making research accessible and 
reproducible (especially in the context of the reproducibility crisis). This 
requires considering all stakeholders, mostly people with responsabilities in 
our universities. As an example, I have contributed to the former in 
[analyzing which are the motivations of spanish researchers to publish in open-access journals](https://redc.revistas.csic.es/index.php/redc/article/view/1555), 
and to the latter through my active involvement in the 
[Federación de Jóvenes Investigadores Precarios](https://fji.precarios.org), 
where we denounce and advocate for improvements in our field.
